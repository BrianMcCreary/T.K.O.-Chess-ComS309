## Project Overview:
Our project, T.K.O. Chess, was a real-time chess and boxing minigame application using Java for our frontend and backend implementation supported by a MySQL database. The project was completed by a team of 4 individuals split into a frontend and backend team. The frontend team consisted of Zachary Scurlock and Alexander Somers. The backend team consisted of Connor Hand and myself, Brian McCreary. The application allowed users to register and log into an account, add/remove/view friends, view win/loss statistics, host/join/manage game lobbies, and play or spectate three different game modes; Chess, boxing, or T.K.O. Chess.

## My Role:
My role was to design and implement backend functionality for player accounts, lobbies, and chess. I also colloborated often with my backend partner, Connor Hand, about what we were both working on at the time and what the best strategies were for the given situations. Additionally, I worked with Zach Scurlock directly for the chess link between the frontend and backend implementations. Lex Somers and I discussed big picture ideas for the app as well as brainstormed ideas when the group was slowing down. I suggested and created a Discord server with separate channels dedicated for the backend and frontend teams for clear and direct communication with the relevant members.

## Skills and Knowledge:
Throughout this project I gained hands on experience in and with fundamental AGILE software development methodologies and many essential development tools. Some of the tools we learned how to use include: Git, Github, Android Studio & emulators, Postman, MySQL, XML, Java, HTTP request & websocket APIs, etc. We also gained experience in software debugging and testing, as one of the requirements for our project was a minimum of 70% code coverage using the JUnit testing framework.
