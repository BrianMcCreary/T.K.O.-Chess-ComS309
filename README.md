## Project Overview:
Our project, T.K.O. Chess, was a real-time chess and boxing minigame application using Java for our frontend and backend implementation supported by a MySQL database. The project was completed by a team of 4 individuals split into a frontend and backend team. The frontend team consisted of Zachary Scurlock and myself, Alexander Somers. The backend team consisted of Brian McCreary and Conner Hand. The application allowed users to register and log into an account, add/remove/view friends, view win loss statistics, host/join/manage game lobbies, and play or spectate three different game modes; Chess, boxing, or T.K.O. Chess.

## My Role:
My role was to design and implement frontend interfaces for a real-time Chess and boxing minigame application enabling user interaction and visualization of the games. Specifically, I designed 18 of the 22 screens used for our app (XML/CSS), and 10 of the 13 java classes used to provide functionality to different interfaces on the screens. This included parts of our app like the login/registration, friend & profile pages, game lobby creation and management, and boxing minigame. I also assisted with setting up and maintaining the MySQL database our project used for user information and with outlining the functionality of our backend.

To view the xml pages, navigate to Frontend/T.K.O_Chess/app/src/main/res/layout (https://github.com/Leaflex/T.K.O.-Chess-ComS-309-/tree/main/Frontend/T.K.O_Chess/app/src/main/res/layout). Other resources used on the design of the frontend screen are found one directory up in /res. 

To view the Java classes, navigate to Frontend/T.K.O_Chess/app/src/main/java/com/example/tko_chess (https://github.com/Leaflex/T.K.O.-Chess-ComS-309-/tree/main/Frontend/T.K.O_Chess/app/src/main/java/com/example/tko_chess). 

## Skills and Knowledge:
Throughout this project I gained hands on experience with fundamental AGILE software development methodologies and many essential development tools. Some of the tools we learned how to use include Git, Github, Android Studio & emulators, Postman, MySQL, XML, Java, HTTP request & websocket APIs, etc. We also gained experience in software debugging and testing, as one of the requirements for our project was a minimum of 70% code coverage using the Junit testing framework. 

## Resources Used:
 - Java
 - Junit
 - XML
 - Postman
 - HTTP Requests/Websockets
 - Android Studio
 - Git/Github
 - MySQL
