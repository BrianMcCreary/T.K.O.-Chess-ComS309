# Total Knock Out (T.K.O.) Chess
Our project, T.K.O. Chess, was a real-time chess and boxing minigame application using Java for our frontend and backend implementation supported by a MySQL database. The project was completed by a team of 4 individuals split into a frontend and backend team. The frontend team consisted of Zachary Scurlock and myself, Alexander Somers. The backend team consisted of Brian McCreary and Conner Hand. The application allowed users to register and log into an account, add/remove/view friends, view win loss statistics, host/join/manage game lobbies, and play or spectate three different game modes; Chess, boxing, or T.K.O. Chess.

# My Work

I was responsible for working on the frontend of our project alongside one of my team members, Zach Scurlock. This consisted of creating most of the screens with xml and providing them with functionality using Java classes. 

To view the xml pages, navigate to Frontend/T.K.O_Chess/app/src/main/res/layout (https://github.com/Leaflex/T.K.O.-Chess-ComS-309-/tree/main/Frontend/T.K.O_Chess/app/src/main/res/layout). Other resources used on the design of the frontend screen are found one directory up in /res. 

To view the Java classes, navigate to Frontend/T.K.O_Chess/app/src/main/java/com/example/tko_chess (https://github.com/Leaflex/T.K.O.-Chess-ComS-309-/tree/main/Frontend/T.K.O_Chess/app/src/main/java/com/example/tko_chess). 

#Awards
T.K.O. Chess was awarded 3rd place in the "best project" competition which consisted of 100 project teams.
